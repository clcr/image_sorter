### Image Sorter

A quick interface for sorting a folder of images into two other folders.

You will need the Python Imaging Library to run this:
`pip install pillow`

To run:
`python image_sorter.py in_dir left_dir right_dir`

Once the image is shown, press the left arrow key to move it into left_dir, or
the right arrow key to move it into right_dir.

Test images from xkcd.com, used under Creative Commons.
